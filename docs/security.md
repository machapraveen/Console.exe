# Console.ext Security Documentation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in Console.ext to protect user data and ensure secure system operation.

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Authentication

Console.ext uses multiple authentication mechanisms:

1. **JWT-based Authentication**
   - JSON Web Tokens for dashboard access
   - Tokens expire after 7 days by default
   - Refresh token rotation for extended sessions

2. **API Key Authentication**
   - 64-character hexadecimal API keys
   - Used for client library authentication
   - Can be regenerated at any time

### Password Security

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with a minimum work factor of 12
- Password strength requirements:
  - Minimum 10 characters
  - Must include uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
- Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts for 15 minutes

### Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

- Optional SMS-based MFA for dashboard login
- Required for security-sensitive operations (e.g., API key regeneration)

## Data Security

### Data Encryption

1. **Encryption at Rest**
   - Sensitive data encrypted in the database
   - AES-256-GCM encryption for all sensitive fields
   - Encryption keys managed using AWS KMS

2. **Encryption in Transit**
   - All HTTP communication over TLS 1.2+
   - Strong cipher suites with forward secrecy
   - HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) enabled

### Data Access Controls

- Role-based access control (RBAC) system
- Limited database access from application servers
- Principle of least privilege for all system components

## API Security

### Rate Limiting

- Global rate limiting: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Authentication rate limiting: 10 login attempts per hour
- Per-user rate limiting: Customizable notification limits

### Input Validation

- Strict schema validation for all API inputs
- Contextual output encoding to prevent XSS
- MongoDB query sanitization to prevent NoSQL injection

### API Versioning

- Explicit API versioning (e.g., /api/v1/...)
- Deprecation notices for outdated endpoints
- Backward compatibility maintained for 6 months

## Infrastructure Security

### Network Security

- Private VPC for all infrastructure components
- Network segmentation between services
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) for public endpoints
- DDoS protection through Cloudflare

### Server Security

- Regular security patches and updates
- Minimal server exposure with bastion hosts
- Host-based firewall rules
- Immutable infrastructure via container deployments

### Monitoring & Alerting

- Real-time security monitoring
- Intrusion detection system
- Anomaly detection for unusual traffic patterns
- Automated alerts for suspicious activities

## Vulnerability Management

### Security Testing

- Regular penetration testing (quarterly)
- Automated vulnerability scanning (weekly)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- Bug bounty program for responsible disclosure

### Patch Management

- Critical security patches: Within 24 hours
- High-severity vulnerabilities: Within 72 hours
- Medium-severity vulnerabilities: Within 1 week
- Low-severity vulnerabilities: Within 1 month

## Compliance & Privacy

### Data Handling

- Personal data minimization
- Configurable data retention policies
- Data erasure capabilities for GDPR compliance
- Export functionality for data portability

### Privacy Controls

- Transparent privacy policy
- Cookie consent management
- Anonymized usage analytics
- No data sharing with third parties except for operational purposes

### Audit Logging

- Comprehensive audit trails for all sensitive operations
- Immutable logs stored securely
- Log retention compliant with regulatory requirements
- Regular log reviews for security incidents

## Incident Response

### Response Plan

1. **Detection & Analysis**
   - Automated detection systems
   - 24/7 monitoring for critical systems
   
2. **Containment**
   - Predefined containment procedures
   - Isolation capabilities for compromised components
   
3. **Eradication & Recovery**
   - Root cause analysis process
   - Clean recovery procedures
   
4. **Post-Incident Analysis**
   - Formal post-mortem process
   - Lessons learned documentation
   - Process improvements implementation

### Communication Plan

- Notification templates for different incident types
- Escalation procedures with defined roles
- Customer communication guidelines
- Regulatory notification procedures where required

## Secure Development

### Secure SDLC

- Security requirements in planning phase
- Threat modeling for new features
- Security code reviews
- Pre-release security testing

### Dependency Management

- Approved dependency list
- Automated dependency scanning
- Regular dependency updates
- Prohibited vulnerable packages

### Coding Standards

- Language-specific secure coding guidelines
- Automated linting for security issues
- Code quality metrics
- Peer review requirements
